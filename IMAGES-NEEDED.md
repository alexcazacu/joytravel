# Images Required for Landing Page

The landing page requires the following images to be added to the `public` directory:

## Landing Images (`/public/landing/`)
- `1.jpg` - Traveler with map
- `2.jpg` - World map (main center image)
- `4.jpg` - Desert sunset
- `5.jpg` - Hiking scene
- `6.jpg` - Tropical beach

## Sri Lanka Section (`/public/sri-lanka/`)
- `sigiriya-rock.jpg` - Sri Lanka Sigiriya Rock image

## Notes
- All images should be optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file sizes)
- Recommended dimensions: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio
- Format: JPG or WebP for best performance
- The images are used in the hero gallery section and Sri Lanka promotion

## Temporary Placeholders
Until you add the actual images, you can:
1. Use placeholder images from services like Unsplash or Pexels
2. Replace with your actual travel photos
3. The page will show broken image placeholders where images are missing
